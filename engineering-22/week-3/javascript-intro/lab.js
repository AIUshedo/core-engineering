// create a variable called firstName that contains a string
var firstName = "Mohammed";
// create an array that contains three names
// use your firstName variable for the third name
var myArray = ["Anthony", "Stefan", "Mohammed",];
// create a variable called numberOfNames that contains the number of people in your names array
var numberOfNames = [2];
// create a variable called age and put an appropriate data type in it
var age = 24;
// create a variable called younger that contains a third of this age
var younger = 8;
// create a null variable called empty
null var = empty
// create a variable called phoneNumber and store this number 07888777396
// ( think about what type of data would be best for this )
var phoneNumber = 07888777396;
// create a variable called friend
// extract the second value from your namesArray and put it in friend
var friend = namesArray[1];
console.log();
// create a variable called sentence that contains the following sentence:
// I'm not a number, I'm fairly sure I'm a String
var sentence = "I'm not a number, I'm fairly sure I'm a string";

// create a variable called sentenceLength that contains the length of the sentence
var sentenceLength = (sentence);
console.log(sentenceLength.length);

// BONUS
// Research how to create a JSON object called person
// Use the person object tests to add the correct data - a name propety that contains the firstName variable, a friends property that contains the namesArray variable, a phoneNumber property that contains the phoneNumber variable, a bestFriend property that contains the friend variable and a quote property that contains the sentence variable
