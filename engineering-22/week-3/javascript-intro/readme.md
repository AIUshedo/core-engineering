console.log is basically system.out.println for the browser console

tagging js is the same as css

alert makes a pop up on screen

onclick basically once you click it this happens

boolean - true or false

string - basic text

integers - whole numbers

float - decimals

when using more than 1 word for name of variable use camelCase in javascript

when using quotes its an item

when using number with no quotes its the number

## strings

length = how long is this variable

indexOf = what position is the variable in (starts at 0)

substr = shows where to start counting and where it should end

## integers

/* = times
// = divide
/- = minus
/+ = add

clear(); - clear the console
+= add this to now and forever
++ adds by 1
-- takes 1 away

## arrays

refer to array example in main.js
remember to count from 0

myArray [4] means Target 4 item in the array

push = puts things at the end of array
pop =takes off the last item in array and gives it to us permanently

you can have arrays inside arrays
refer to myMultidimensionalArray

when requested the console gives out the WHOLE array

when targeting specific item in second or more arrays just do 2[][] to get item

parseInt makes an object a integer(whole number)

parseFloat makes an object a float(decimal)

# Control flow
